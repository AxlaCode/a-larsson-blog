Hi there!

My name is Axel Larsson and I'm a PhD student at [Form Finding Lab](http://formfindinglab.princeton.edu) at Princeton University

This is my personal and professional blog to chronicle my journey towards my PhD degree. I'll be mainly posting interesting insights from the world of science, mixed with different thoughts, opinions, handy code snippets, reviews etc.
